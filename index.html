Using Infura as a provider, you can reliably send and receive messages to/from the Ethereum blockchain without needing to set up and maintain your own node.

(If you haven't used it before, you'll definitely want to go and install it — then your browser is Web3 enabled, and you can now interact with any website that communicates with the Ethereum blockchain!).
      //And as a developer, if you want users to interact with your DApp through a website in their web browser (like we're doing with our CryptoZombies game), you'll definitely want to make it Metamask-compatible.
      //Metamask injects their web3 provider into the browser in the global JavaScript object web3. So your app can check to see if web3 exists, and if it does use web3.currentProvider as its provider.

    // order to use our app.
